### Generator of passwords and random IDs for users.

The Passnerator project was developed in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.
Humans include personal information in their passwords, information that can often be found on social media accounts, and can potentially be used by cybercriminals to crack passwords, such as:

Their own name or the name of a family member, Their petâ€™s name, Their birthday, Words related to their hobby, Part of their home address, The name of their favorite book or movie, Celebrity names, The name of the website the password is for. With Passnerator your passwords are generated randomly so that all your accesses are leak-free.
