#### Generator of passwords and random IDs for users.

The Passnerator project was developed in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. Many people include personal information in their passwords, information that can be found on social network accounts and which can be used to discover their passwords. Many people are in the habit of reusing passwords on several accounts. If a weak password is compromised, all accounts using that same password will be at risk. Using strong, unique passwords for each account reduces the risk of several accounts being compromised in the event of a single security breach.

The biggest mistakes are: Your own name or the name of a family member, the name of a pet, your birthday, words related to your hobby, part of your home address, the name of your favorite book or movie, celebrity names, the name of the website for which the password is used. With Passnerator, your passwords are generated randomly so that all your accesses are leak-free.  

Using strong passwords prevents unauthorized access to your accounts. This is especially important for accounts that contain confidential information or have access to other valuable resources, such as work accounts, corporate systems and financial services.

|   Maximum length of the password   | 100 |

#### Database used:

|   Character option              |         Database                 |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|   Upper case characters         |    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ    |
|   Lower case characters         |    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz    |
|   numbers                       |    0123456789                    |
|   Special characters            |    !@#$&*_.-+:%                  |

### Functionalities

The user can add the number of characters the password will have. It can vary with character options, use uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or symbols. You can never be too safe!

#### Tips for creating strong passwords:

1. Use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.
2. Avoid using obvious personal information such as names, dates of birth or common words.
3. Make sure the password is at least 12 characters long. The longer, the better.
4. Combine several words to create a long phrase that is easy to remember but difficult to guess (for example: " two!Rabb1ts#GReen7 ").
5. Replace letters with numbers or symbols that look similar (for example, "P@ssw0rd" instead of "Password").
6. Use unique passwords for each account to prevent the compromise of one password from affecting other accounts.

#### Additional password management tips:

- **Activate two-factor authentication (2FA)**: In addition to a strong password, using 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification factor, such as a code sent to your phone.

- **Update your passwords regularly**: Changing your passwords periodically can help reduce the risk of your accounts being compromised, especially if there is a suspicion that your information may have been exposed.

- **Avoid writing down passwords in unsecured places**: If you need to write down your passwords, make sure they are stored in a secure place that is inaccessible to third parties.
